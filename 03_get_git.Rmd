```

Our first objective today will be to sync to the class github. We will
go over a few needed things to establish git connections:

Sign up for github -- if you already have please make a new github repository. 


## The very first thing we need to do is make the github website communicate 
with Fiji. Once this relationship is established, you don't need to do this again :)

Navigate to your home directory on fiji ~/IDENTIKEY

```
ls -lah
```
Note that there is a .ssh folder that you can place these unique keys to let
servers communicate securely. We generate this with ssh-keygen command. 

```
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa.pub
```
This will reveal the public ssh key for fiji. However we want to make a new
ssh key for each connection. We can easily do this by:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
Then save this to your id_rsa.pub file using nano and paste in. Also copy to clipboard.
Or you ssh-keygen will ask you to make a file name in which to put this generated ssh key.

Now let's got to your github website. You will need to sign into your github account first.

On the top rigth there is a drop down 
menu. Click on "settings". Now you will see on the left side there is a list of
options. Click on "keys to deploy". There already be some keys in there or blank.
Either way click "Add new key" on top right (green button). Paste in the new
public SSH key we just generated. 

You may also want to go to your local computer shell .ssh folder (same place).
Generate a key and paste into github as done above. This way your local terminal
(not fiji server) can push to github too. Basically any machine(s) you want to
talk to github need this "handshake" SSH key.

Cool we are all connected !

-------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's see how this all it works:

Navigate back to ~/IDENTIKEY

Let's have fiji get ready to talk to git !

#initialize a git repository for the working directory 

```
git init
ls -a
```

Now we see a generic .git folder. 
Next we need to "clone" the git repository of interest
Navigate to the git repository and you will see on the righ side
"clone this wiki locally"
click the copy button.
Navigte back to your folder on fiji and type:

```
git clone PASTE-URL
```

Voila you are connected to our class 2021 git repository.

Let's try it out:

```
Nano test.Rmd
#Type in something
# exit nano
git add test.Rmd
git status
```

Do you see a new item (test.Rmd) that git noticed was made and ready to sync?

Let's sync so we are up to date. But we don't really want to ever do this on the
master branch on github. We usually make a "branch" to work on and then "merge"
branches later once the final code is compiled.

So let's switch to the "students" branch

```
git checkout -b students
```
Now you should be on the students branch of the git site. Sometimes this can get
buggy so you can also trying forcing a branch move:

```
git push -u origin NEW-BRANCH-NAME
```

Or you may receive an error something like: 
fatal: The current branch students has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin students

Just paste in that and it will work.

Ok let's update the github website from the terminal!

```
git status
git add test.Rmd
git commit -m "(put the notes you want on what was done inside the quotes)"
git push
# type git push again and you should see "up to date"

! Always remember to PUSH before you END a session !
! Always remember to PULL before you START a session !
```

If you are collaborating on a git-branch when you start a session it's always good to "pull" any updates since you last logged in. this can easily be done by:

```
git pull
```

If you want to check out previous changes you can use :

```
git log
git diff Xsum1 Xsum2
```

This will show you all the changes -- you can also do this a bit more user friendly on git website.

Finally we need a text file titled ".gitignore" put all the file types you don't want to track. These are large files such as .csv or .pdf etc here are some examples


```
touch .gitignore
nano .gitignore
# add extensions of files that are large (pdf, images etc)
# for this class copy and paste the following into .gitignore using nano
```


.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
*.bam
*.pdf
*.Rproj
*.Rproj
*.pdf
*.png
*results*
*figures*
*bam*
*.tmp
*html
*.bed
*_rslurm*
*.chain
*.bed*
*data*
*.txt
*.csv
*archive*



-----------------------------------------------
Let's all get set up on fiji and github website using this info ....
